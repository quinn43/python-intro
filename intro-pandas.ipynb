    "\n",
    "#### Installation\n",
    "If you have never worked with python before, one way of getting started is to install a package manager such as <a href=\"https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy\">Canopy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/\">Anaconda</a> on your computer. This will install a current version of python as well as well as an easy way to install hundreds of python libraries -- including pandas, jupyter, matplotlib, and other libraries which we will be discussing in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to run notebooks on Google Drive, which should have most of the needed libraries available and lets you easily share your code with others. To open a new notebook on Google Drive, click the \"New\" button, select \"More\" and then \"<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Colaboratory</a>.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown cells\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks (such as this one!) let you combine your code with something called \"markdown\" cells. These let you add chapters and explanatory text, including <a href=\"www.greenpeace.org\">HTML</a> and LaTeX-style equations ($E=mc^2$) to your code. This allows you to convert your analysis into a readable document that describes everything you are doing and the steps you take to reach your conclusions. You can even save it as HTML and share it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Double click on a markdown cell to see how it is constructed, then hit Shift-Return to execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code cells\n",
    "These cells contain the python code that you will write to conduct your analysis. Any line starting with # is a comment and is not executed. Hit Shift-Return to execute the cell and run the code. If any output is generated it will appear below the cell, labeled \"Out.\" \n",
